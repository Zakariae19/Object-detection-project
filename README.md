Hello to the object detection app that uses Tensorflow as a framework, and OpenCv for the output.
Follow these steps :

1-Download the repository from "Download Zip" as a zipfile 
2-Go to the folder and extract files and then name it as models
3-Inside the folder, you find research folder that contains the main files for running the application such as object_detection folder and you can also find 2 files named Test_TF_webcam.py and Test_image_py and the jupyter format too "ipynb"
4-Open Command Prompt and run this commad python -m venv name_of_virtual_environment, note that creating a virtual environment where you can download all the libraries you need for this application, is a smart move to do, because in the future you won't start from the scratch, you would just import the virtuel env that you've created before
5-Install vs code community "latest version" from the official website
6-Open the models folder in it and run the codes
